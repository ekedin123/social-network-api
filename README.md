  the user can clone into the project through git bash and run `npm i` in their terminal or IDE to install the dependencies.
  the user will create and seed the database, then decide which http requests they want to use within Insomnia
  the user then can use Insomnia or their IDE to view the results of the data in the database and test different data points.

  ## Usage 
  
  Once the user has installed the required dependencies, seeded the database, and initialized the server with `npm run start`, the user can open insomnia and build test routes for finding and creating users, thoughts, and reactions.
